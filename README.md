# Insert-game-name

This is the github page for a game that me and my (4) friends are working on. When this game is finished I will put the user rights in the licence section of this README, found underneath this message, but until then the game is strictly not for the public. Do not expect the game to be released for probably a long time as this is all of our's (except for me, but so far mine have just been testing and learning) first game.
